# Paranoid (Black Sabbath) synth cover

This is my attempt to learn the basics of Ableton Live by doing a cover of [Paranoid]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_(Black_Sabbath_song))https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_(Black_Sabbath_song)) by [Black Sabbath]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath).

The song is completely done from scratch, but I had to import the guitar solo from a MIDI file. 

There is a MIDI track for each instrument, whereas vocals are rendered as an Audio track.

Ozzy's voice is isolated via [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/nl/) starting from an MP3 downloaded from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qanF-91aJo).
